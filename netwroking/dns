What is DNS
===========
As human beings, we are good at remembering names, but computers identify systems on the internet using IP addresses, not names.
DNS (Domain Name System) maintains a list of IP addresses mapped to their corresponding domain names.
It translates domain names (like google.com) into their matching IP addresses, so that browsers and systems can connect to the correct server.

How DNS Works
==============

DNS works like a chain of lookups. Here's how it works step-by-step:

- User enters a domain name in the browser — e.g., www.example.com.

- Browser checks local DNS cache to see if it already knows the IP address.

- If not found, it sends a query to a recursive DNS resolver (usually provided by your ISP or public DNS like Google DNS 8.8.8.8).

- The resolver contacts the Root DNS Server, which replies with the address of the TLD (Top-Level Domain) server — for .com, .org, .in, etc.

- The resolver then contacts the TLD Server, which returns the IP of the authoritative DNS server for the domain.

- The resolver asks the authoritative server for the IP of www.example.com.

- The authoritative server replies with the IP address.

- The resolver gives the IP to the browser, which can now connect to the server and load the website.

Note: This whole process usually happens in milliseconds.
