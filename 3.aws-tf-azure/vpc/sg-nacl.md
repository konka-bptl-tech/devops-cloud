# Ports
A port is simply a number in networking that's used to identify a specific service or process running on a machine

**Example**
| IP Address    | Port | Service        |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------- |
| 192.168.1.100 | 22   | SSH            |
| 192.168.1.100 | 80   | Web server     |
| 192.168.1.100 | 3306 | MySQL database |

Even though all services run on the same IP, the port number helps route the traffic to the correct application.

# Protocols
A protocol is a set of rules that defines how data is transmitted between devices in a network.
## 🔀 **TCP vs UDP**
| Feature               | **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) | **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol)   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 🔗 **Connection**     | Connection-oriented                     | Connectionless                     |
| ✅ **Reliability**     | Reliable (guarantees delivery)          | Not reliable (no guarantee)        |
| 🔁 **Data Order**     | Data arrives in the correct order       | Data may arrive out of order       |
| 📥 **Acknowledgment** | Sends ACKs to confirm receipt           | No acknowledgment                  |
| 🐢 **Speed**          | Slower (due to handshakes, error check) | Faster (no overhead)               |
| 🧱 **Use Cases**      | Web (HTTP/HTTPS), SSH, FTP, Email       | DNS, Video Streaming, VoIP, Gaming |
| 🔐 **Handshake**      | Yes (3-way handshake)                   | No handshake                       |
| 🔄 **Resend Packets** | Yes, if lost                            | No automatic resend                |

## 📦 Common Types of Protocols:
| Protocol  | Type    | Purpose                  | Port Example |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| **HTTP**  | TCP     | Web traffic (insecure)   | 80           |
| **HTTPS** | TCP     | Web traffic (secure/SSL) | 443          |
| **FTP**   | TCP     | File Transfer            | 21           |
| **SSH**   | TCP     | Secure remote login      | 22           |
| **DNS**   | UDP/TCP | Domain name resolution   | 53           |
| **SMTP**  | TCP     | Sending emails           | 25           |
| **SNMP**  | UDP     | Network monitoring       | 161          |
| **NTP**   | UDP     | Time synchronization     | 123          |

### 🔹 **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
* Connection-oriented
* Reliable, ordered delivery
* Used for web, SSH, FTP, email, etc.
### 🔸 **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
* Connectionless
* Faster, but no guarantee of delivery
* Used for DNS, video streaming, VoIP, etc.

* **TCP** is like a phone call — both sides connect, speak clearly, and confirm delivery.
* **UDP** is like sending a letter — it might arrive, or it might get lost, but it’s fast and doesn't wait for confirmation.

Great question Konka! Let's clear your confusion with a simple explanation 👇

---

## ✅ First: **Are HTTP and HTTPS protocols?**

> **Yes.**
> **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** and **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)** are **application layer protocols** used for web communication.

* They define **how web browsers and servers exchange data** (like loading websites).
* **HTTPS** is just **HTTP + SSL/TLS encryption** for secure communication.

---

## ✅ Then what is **TCP**?

> **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is a **transport layer protocol**.

It defines **how data should be sent across a network**, making sure it:

* Arrives in order
* Has no errors
* Is acknowledged

---

## 🤝 How do they work together?

Think of it like layers:

```
Application Layer  →  HTTP / HTTPS
Transport Layer    →  TCP
Network Layer      →  IP
```

When you open a website:

1. **HTTP/HTTPS** defines **what data is being sent** (like a GET request for a web page).
2. **TCP** ensures that data is **reliably delivered** between your browser and the server.


## 🎯 Simple Analogy:

* **HTTP/HTTPS** = What you're saying (the message content)
* **TCP** = How you send the message (in an envelope with tracking)

### 🧪 Real Example:

When you visit:

```
https://example.com
```

* Your browser uses **HTTPS** to communicate with the server.
* HTTPS uses **TCP** to reliably send and receive that data.

# Firewalls
> A **firewall** is a **security system** that controls the **incoming and outgoing network traffic** based on **rules**.

It acts like a **gatekeeper** that decides whether to **allow or block traffic** between your device (or network) and the internet or other networks.

---

### 🔐 You can say:

> **"A firewall filters network traffic based on IP address, port number, and protocol, and only allows traffic that matches defined security rules."**

---

## 🧱 Types of Firewalls

| Type                | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Host-based**      | Installed on individual machines (e.g., Windows Firewall, iptables on Linux) |
| **Network-based**   | Deployed at network level (e.g., between LAN and Internet)                   |
| **Cloud Firewalls** | AWS Security Groups, Azure NSGs, GCP firewall rules                          |

---

## 📦 What Can It Filter?

* **IP Address** (source or destination)
* **Port Number** (e.g., block port 22/SSH)
* **Protocol** (e.g., block all UDP traffic)
* **Application layer rules** (in next-gen firewalls)

---

## ✅ Example:

**Scenario:**
You want to **block all SSH access (port 22)** from the public internet to your EC2 instance.

🔐 You create a firewall rule (in AWS it's called a **Security Group**) like:

```
Deny: 0.0.0.0/0 → port 22
Allow: 192.168.1.10 → port 22
```

Only one trusted IP can access via SSH. Others are blocked.

---

## 🧪 Real Life Analogy:

* A **firewall is like a bouncer at a club**.
  He checks:

  * Who you are (IP)
  * What you're carrying (protocol)
  * What door you're trying to enter (port)

If you're on the list (allowed), you get in. If not, you're blocked.

# Ingress/Inbound & Egress/Outbound
Perfect Konka! Let's simplify **Ingress vs Egress** (Inbound vs Outbound) — especially useful for interviews and cloud/networking topics.

---

## 🔁 Ingress vs Egress

| Term        | Direction                | Meaning                           | Example                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Ingress** | Inbound to the system    | Traffic coming **into** a system  | User accessing your web app (HTTP request) |
| **Egress**  | Outbound from the system | Traffic going **out of** a system | Your app calling an external API           |

---

## 📦 In Simple Terms:

* **Ingress** = Something coming **IN**
* **Egress** = Something going **OUT**

# Stateless firewalls
- The response traffic not allowed automatically.Explicitly allow the return traffic[Ex:NACLS]
- Most of the firewalls are stateless by nature
# Stateful firewalls
- The response traffic automatically allowed then we call as stateful firewalls[EX:SG,NetowrkPolicies]
- They store state of incoming request so that when ever they replay they know they are replaying same connection that was initiated before 
- If originating traffic is allow automatically response traffic is allowed
# Ephemeral ports

Ephemeral ports are temporary port numbers assigned automatically by the operating system to the client side of a network connection.

# Network Access Controls List[NACL]

> A **Network ACL** is a **stateless firewall** in AWS that controls **inbound and outbound traffic** **at the subnet level** in your VPC.

It defines **allow or deny rules** based on:

* Source/Destination IP
* Port number
* Protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.)

---

## 🧱 Key Characteristics

| Feature             | Description                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 **Stateless**    | Return traffic must be **explicitly allowed** |
| 📍 **Subnet-level** | Applies to **all resources in the subnet**    |
| ➕➖ **Allow & Deny** | Can **allow or deny** traffic                 |
| ⬆️ **Rule Order**   | Evaluated by **rule number** (lowest first)   |
| 🌐 **Applies to**   | EC2, RDS, etc. inside subnets                 |

---

## 📥 Example Rule Set

| Rule # | Type    | Protocol | Port Range | Source/Dest | Action |
| ------ | ------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 100    | Inbound | TCP      | 22         | 0.0.0.0/0   | ALLOW  |
| 110    | Inbound | TCP      | 80         | 0.0.0.0/0   | ALLOW  |
| \*     | Inbound | ALL      | ALL        | ALL         | DENY   |

> This allows SSH & HTTP but blocks everything else.

---

## 🔄 Stateless = Must Allow Both Ways

If you allow incoming traffic on port 80, you **must also allow outgoing return traffic** using ephemeral ports (e.g., 1024–65535), or it won’t work.

---

## ✅ Common Use Case

> **Restrict public access to private subnets**
> You can block all inbound traffic to private subnets using NACLs, even if a security group allows it — extra layer of control.

---

## 🎯 Interview One-Liner:

> **"A Network ACL is a stateless firewall in AWS that controls traffic at the subnet level using numbered allow/deny rules for both inbound and outbound directions."**

# Security Groups
Absolutely Konka! Here's a clean breakdown of **Security Groups** in AWS — short, simple, and **interview-ready** ✅

---

## 🔐 What is a **Security Group**?

> A **Security Group** in AWS acts as a **virtual firewall** that controls **inbound and outbound traffic** **at the instance level** (like EC2, RDS, etc.).

---

## 🧱 Key Characteristics

| Feature               | Description                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 **Stateful**       | Return traffic is **automatically allowed**         |
| 🎯 **Instance-level** | Applied **directly to instances**, not subnets      |
| ➕ **Only allows**     | You can **only ALLOW** traffic, no DENY             |
| 📄 **Rules based on** | Protocol, Port range, Source/Destination (IP or SG) |
| 👥 **Multiple SGs**   | An instance can have **multiple security groups**   |

---

## 📥 Example Rules

### ✅ Inbound (for a web server)

| Type | Protocol | Port | Source    | Description  |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | --------- | ------------ |
| SSH  | TCP      | 22   | Your IP   | Admin access |
| HTTP | TCP      | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0 | Public web   |

### ✅ Outbound (default)

| Type | Protocol | Port | Destination |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| ALL  | ALL      | ALL  | 0.0.0.0/0   |

---

## 🔁 Stateful Means:

* If you allow **inbound on port 80**, **outbound response is auto-allowed**
* You don’t need to define outbound rules to allow the response

---

## 🧪 Real Example:

> You launch an EC2 instance and attach a security group:
>
> * Inbound: Allow SSH from your IP (`port 22`)
> * Outbound: All traffic allowed (default)
>
> Now you can SSH into it, and responses work because **SG is stateful**.

---

## 🧠 One-liner for interview:

> **"A security group is a stateful, instance-level virtual firewall in AWS that controls allowed inbound and outbound traffic using rules based on ports, protocols, and IPs."**
